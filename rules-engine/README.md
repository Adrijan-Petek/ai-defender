# Rules Engine

This folder is reserved for future rule authoring/distribution formats.

Current MVP detection rules live in `agent-core/src/rules_engine/` and are primarily used for **learning, tuning, and local incident logging**.

AI Defender defaults to **Learning Mode – Monitoring Only** and does not auto-contain by default.
