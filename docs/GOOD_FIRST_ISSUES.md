# Good first issues

These are beginner-friendly tasks that improve trust, documentation quality, and developer ergonomics. None of these require adding new enforcement behavior.

1) Add additional protected-path test cases (mixed slashes, profile variants, odd casing).
2) Add unit tests for allowlist edge cases (empty strings, whitespace-only, duplicates).
3) Improve documentation wording for recovery steps (clarity and calm tone).
4) Add a small “incident export” format spec (JSON schema) documentation (no new features; doc-only).
5) Improve rule documentation with more examples of evidence fields (doc-only).
6) Polish tray UI strings for consistency and Windows-native tone (no logic changes).
7) Add a developer “smoke test” checklist doc section for local runs (doc-only).
8) Add more correlation-window unit tests for multiple sensitive accesses per PID.
9) Document how to reproduce sample incidents using `--simulate` (doc-only).
10) Add a short glossary (Event/Finding/Incident/Action) to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (doc-only).
