# Contributing to AI Defender

Thanks for considering contributing. This repository is an early-stage, defensive-only Windows security project.

## Project principles

- Defensive-only: do not add offensive capabilities, persistence, or bypass techniques.
- Default to safety, reversibility, and transparency.
- Learning mode is the default. Avoid aggressive enforcement.
- No hidden telemetry or cloud dependence in core logic.

## What to contribute

- Detection tuning and false-positive reduction
- Documentation improvements
- Tests for rule matching/correlation logic
- UI clarity and user trust improvements
- Installer hardening (reversible install/uninstall)

## Security issues

Do not file public issues for vulnerabilities. Follow `SECURITY.md`.
